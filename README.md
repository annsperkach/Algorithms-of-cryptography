# Algorithms-of-cryptography
Basic algorithms of number theory and cryptography

#Tasks
Using the long arithmetic module, implement basic algorithms of cryptography and number theory:
1) One long integer factorization algorithm to choose from: Pollard's rho-algorithm
or the quadratic lattice algorithm.
2) One algorithm for finding a discrete logarithm to choose: ro-algorithm
Pollard or the "big step - small step" algorithm.
3) Calculation of Euler and MÃ¶bius functions.
4) Calculation of Legendre and Jacobi symbols.
5) Chippola's algorithm for finding a discrete square root.
6) Choose one algorithm for checking numbers for simplicity: Solovei Strassen algorithm or Miller-Rabin algorithm.
7) The El-Gamal cryptosystem over elliptic curves
